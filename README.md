# Rust 6502 Emulator

This is my attempt at writing a 6502 emulator in Rust in my spare time. Given that I don't have any current Rust opportunities in my day job, I like to every once and a while pick up a project that helps it stay relevant in my brain.




## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DaveKram/emulator
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd emulator
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  cargo run
```
